Here, i have included PSMnet for finding disparity.
On an initial research of point clouds i came across stereo-block matching for finding disparity, which works pretty well but can have disadvantages like: <br >
it can work well on diverse situations and if a wall is met, it will struggle to give an accurate reading. <br>
moreover, stereo-block matching is time consuming as it has to go through comparison of each block through the entire image. 

so we come in for deep learning approaches, i will try out more networks out there and post it, until then you can use the ones available.  

As, for the PSMnet.py file, all basic building blocks are combined and given as single file, welcome to clone and change network according to needs.
